## Introduction

The Gasless Module enables transactions on a Cosmos SDK-based blockchain without requiring users to pay gas fees directly.

The following documentation outlines the technical flow of transactions incorporating the Gasless Module.

This document specifies the internal `x/gasless` module on the network.
